Ben is inspired by Minecraft and how it's possible to create logic gates within the game. He decides to make real-world versions of the blocks, switches, torches, and redstone needed to build the gates. He aims to create a fun, hands-on way to learn about logic gates. In part onen of the series he goes over the plan and builds the red stone blocks.

In the second part of the series, Ben continues to build real-world versions of Minecraft blocks, switches, torches, and more. Each block will have a role in creating logic gates just like in the Minecraft game. Ben shows you how he builds each kind of block and does some tests along the way. Once all the pieces are working, he tries building some live action logic gates.
